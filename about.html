            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello World. I was born in Mexico City on October 16th, 1973. I grew up in Los Angeles, CA, but now live
                in
                San Bernardino, CA. I've always had a passion for art and design since a young kid.
                I moved back to Mexico City in my early 20's where I studied Graphic Design and Illustration
                at Universidad Tecnologica de Mexico (UNITEC).
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduating college, I moved back to So. California where I planned to pursue a
                career in webpage design. Unfortunately, I switched careers to automobile sales which lasted
                about 18 years.
            </p>

                I started learning Web Develpment in early 2020 with an online course in Udemy by Colt Steel.
                Later in May of 2021 I enrolled in a Software Engineer Bootcamp at University of California Riverside
                which I am currently enrolled.
